# Description

Implementation of a persistent queue in Python. I looked around and couldn't find anything that fit my needs, so I made my own. Example usage:

```python
from persistent_queue import PersistentQueue

queue = PersistentQueue('queue')

# Add stuff
queue.push(1)
queue.push(2)
queue.push(3)
queue.push(['a', 'b', 'c'])

data = queue.peek()  # 1
data = queue.peek(4)  # [1, 2, 3, 'a']
size = len(queue)  # 6

queue.push('foobar')

data = queue.pop()  # 1

queue.delete(2)
data = queue.pop()  # 3

queue.clear()
```

Objects that are added to the queue must be pickle-able. A file is saved to the file system based on the name given to the queue. The same name must be given if you want the data to persist.

I created this with the following workflow in mind:

```python

data = queue.peek(5)

success = upload_data_somewhere(data)

if success:
    queue.delete(5)
    queue.flush()  # Remove extra space

```

By default, `pickle` is used to serialize objects. This can be changed depending on your needs by setting the `dumps` and `loads` options (see Parameters). [dill](http://trac.mystic.cacr.caltech.edu/project/pathos/wiki/dill.html) and [msgpack](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-python) have been tested (see tests as an example).

When items are popped or deleted, the data isn't actually deleted. Instead a pointer is moved to the place in the file with valid data. As a result, the file will continue to grow even if items are removed. `persistent_queue.flush()` reclaims this space. **You must call `flush` as you see fit!**

# Parameters

A persistent queue takes the following parameters:

- `filename` (*required*): The name of the file that will keep the data.
- `path` (*optional*, default='.'): The directory to put the file.
- `dumps` (*optional*, default=`pickle.dumps`): The method used to convert a Python object into bytes.
- `loads` (*optional*, default=`pickle.loads`): The method used to convert bytes into a Python object.
- `flush_limit` (*optional*, default=1048576): When the amount of empty space in the file is greater than `flush_limit`, the file will be flushed. This balances file I/O and storage space.

# Install

```
pip install python-persistent-queue
```
